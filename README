Update: this repository is out of date. It contains strictly less
useful code than the repository at the following URL:

https://github.com/carlini/nn_robust_attacks


In particular, do not use the l0 attack in this repository; it is
only good at breaking defensive distillation (not other attacks).

Defensive Distillation was recently proposed as a defense to
adversarial examples.

Unfortunately, distillation is not secure. We show this in our paper, at
http://nicholas.carlini.com/papers/2016_defensivedistillation.pdf
We strongly believe that research should be reproducible, and so our
releasing the code required to train a baseline model on MNIST, train
a defensively distilled model on MNIST, and attack the defensively
distilled model.

To run the code, you will need Python 3.x with TensorFlow. It will be slow
unless you have a GPU to train on.

Begin by running train_baseline.py and train_distillation.py; that will
create three model files, two of which are useful. They should report
final accuracy around 99.3% +/-0.2%.

To construct adversarial examples, run l0_attack.py passing as argument
either models/baseline models/distilled. This will run the modified l0
adversary on the given model. The success probability should be ~95%
modifying ~35 pixels.
